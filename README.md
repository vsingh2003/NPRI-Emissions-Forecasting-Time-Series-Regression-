# NPRI-Emissions-Forecasting-Time-Series-Regression-
## 📊 Project Overview  
This project focused on forecasting pollution trends using time series data from Canada's **National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)** for the fossil fuel electricity generation sector (2000–2022). The goal was to support environmental impact assessments related to phasing out coal plants.

## 👨‍💻 My Role
- 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed time-series data  
- 🧮 Engineered lag-based features to support sequential modeling  
- 🧪 Tuned and compared multiple regression models for forecasting performance  

## ✅ Results
- 📈 Achieved **95.76% accuracy** using **Linear Regression**  
- 📉 Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics for reliable forecasting  
- 💡 Provided insights into emission patterns to support sustainability decisions  

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)  
- Time Series Forecasting  
- Regression Modeling & Feature Engineering
